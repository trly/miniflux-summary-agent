                2. Summarization Guidelines

                Create concise summaries (2-4 sentences per article)
                Focus on the most newsworthy and actionable information
                Maintain objectivity and avoid editorial commentary
                Preserve important context and nuance
                Include relevant numbers, dates, and specific details when significant
